# Asset review — The Sunday Edit

Reviewed 2026-09-23 for planning. This is a source inspection record, not a claim that a site has been built or media has passed release QA.

## Evidence and identifiers

The [inventory](../superpowers/reference/2026-09-23-asset-inventory.json) records Drive IDs, ordinary source links, original filenames, byte sizes, SHA-256 checksums, image dimensions, and stable review keys.

All 30 images were downloaded through the connected Drive source and inspected in a contact sheet. Original files remain temporary working copies; implementation must retrieve or retain approved originals in its ignored source directory and verify checksums. No signed download URLs were saved in the repository.

These observations are for art direction, not final alternative text. Write final alt text after examining each image at its displayed size; describe relevant visible content without inferred identities or invented product attribution.

## Recorded user decision

The user explicitly instructed **“Retain the supplied image unchanged”** in response to the C06/Fair Club question. This resolves that specific source conflict. Keep its wordmark intact and include the image; do not ask again or silently retouch it.

## Source-name correction

The product sheet spells the back view “Lusia back.webp”. The supplied folder contains **Luisa back.webp**, Drive ID `1OTCQxZ4QYrr51rs8rQScQViOtqqgtkF_`, review key P05. Bind that exact file to Luisa Jacket.

## Typography and identity

No separate logo or font files were present in the reviewed campaign/creative/product folders. The proposed design uses a typeset collaboration lockup and treats approved local script/Baskerville-style fonts as a pre-build creative dependency. A question about existing brand files was sent; no answer was available when this record was prepared. Do not infer a named font or licence from the brief’s “sign paper house script” phrase.

## Video review status

Six MP4 files were retrieved and hashed; their aggregate original size is 104,520,683 bytes. Their names all begin “ScreenRecording”. AVFoundation could read metadata, including portrait dimensions and audio tracks, but frame extraction failed with “Cannot Decode” in this environment. No visual or audio approval is claimed, and this failure alone does not establish that the sources are damaged.

The implementation must inspect the actual clips in a working player and verify:
- whether screen-recording interface elements or unrelated frames appear;
- which complete clip/time range fits the editorial sequence;
- browser-compatible codec, orientation, and playback;
- audio content and any meaningful speech/text requiring captions;
- a source-derived poster, clean fallbacks, and the final compressed derivative.

Use a photography-led cover meanwhile. Video is still a tracked part of the creative brief; if no supplied clip is suitable, request a clean supplied replacement before calling that requirement complete. Do not generate or source a substitute.

## Planning review coverage

All 24 campaign images are assigned once: two cover images, 21 spread images, one story image. All six product images appear in the product section. Seven editorial spreads plus a story preserve the brief’s three main sections. No asset is excluded because it is visually inconvenient.


## Implementation review, 2026-09-23

Software decoding with FFmpeg 7.1 succeeded for all six HEVC clips. Sampled frames from every clip were inspected; V01 was reviewed throughout its 10.95 seconds using half-second frames. Selected V01: woman in green beside/in a golf cart, consistent framing, no visible player interface or unrelated insert. V02/V05 have visible interface corners; V04 has embedded headline; V03/V05 include other explicit branding; V06 is a coastal golf sequence. Only V01 is used.

V01 is encoded H.264/yuv420p at 720×1564, 30fps, CRF23, fast-start, without audio. Its poster is from 0.5 seconds of the original. Original and derivative SHA-256 values are recorded; the silent scene has no dialogue or instructional information requiring a speech transcript. Browser playback is checked separately in QA. No content was generated or substituted.
